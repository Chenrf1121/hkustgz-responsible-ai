Explore privacy-preserving machine learning techniques in this hands-on assignment. You will:

1. **Privacy Attacks**: Implement and evaluate membership inference attacks
2. **Differential Privacy**: Train models with differential privacy guarantees
3. **Federated Learning**: Implement a simple federated learning system
4. **Privacy-Utility Tradeoff**: Analyze the tradeoff between privacy and model performance
5. **Evaluation**: Compare different privacy-preserving approaches

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand privacy vulnerabilities in ML systems
- Implement differential privacy mechanisms
- Work with federated learning frameworks
- Evaluate privacy-utility tradeoffs

**Deliverables:**
- Implementation of privacy attacks and defenses
- Experimental results and analysis
- Report on privacy-utility tradeoffs

**Resources:**
- [TensorFlow Privacy](https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy)
- [Opacus (PyTorch)](https://opacus.ai/)
- [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft)
