In this assignment, you will explore bias in real-world datasets and machine learning models. You will:

1. **Data Analysis**: Analyze a provided dataset for potential sources of bias
2. **Bias Detection**: Implement methods to detect different types of bias in the data
3. **Fairness Metrics**: Calculate various fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds, etc.)
4. **Mitigation Strategies**: Apply and evaluate bias mitigation techniques
5. **Report**: Write a report documenting your findings and recommendations

**Learning Objectives:**
- Identify sources of bias in datasets
- Compute and interpret fairness metrics
- Apply bias mitigation techniques
- Critically evaluate trade-offs between fairness and performance

**Deliverables:**
- Python notebook with your analysis and code
- Written report (4-6 pages)
- Reflection on ethical implications

**Resources:**
- [Fairlearn Library](https://fairlearn.org/)
- [AIF360 Toolkit](https://aif360.mybluemix.net/)
