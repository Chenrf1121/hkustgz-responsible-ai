**Topics Covered:**
- **What is AI**: Agents, perceptions, actions, and environment
- **AI Timeline**: From 1900s to 2025+ (AI winters, transformers, LLMs, AGI)
- **Example AI Models**:
  - Natural Language Processing (LLM): Transformer, code generation
  - Computer Vision: CLIP, image captioning, medical segmentation
  - Robotics: Vision-Language-Action models (RT-2)
- **AI Responsibility Challenges**:
  - **Explainability**: Understanding model decisions (from linear models to LLMs), Chain-of-Thought limitations, mechanistic interpretability
  - **Uncertainty**: Aleatoric vs. epistemic uncertainty, impact on LLM performance, robotics navigation, self-driving vehicles
  - **AI Harms**: Safety (hallucination, jailbreaking, prompt injection, data poisoning), privacy (data leakage, memorization), fairness
